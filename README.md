# Classicmodel Company Business
This project was made as a mandatory task for HIMATIKA ITB MySQL short course in Feb 2022.

## Business Understanding
### Background
Classicmodel is a retail company which sales scale models classic (but not limited to) cars to various stores 
around the world.

### Problem
1. Optimize the **business environment** (e.g making sure that good performance employees are given good incentives)
2. See the **business record** of the company, is there any incremental or decremental **trend**?
3. Optimize the **marketing** and **business strategies**

### Analytical Approach
1. To find the best employee with the title of ‘Sales Rep’.
2. To give a view on each region’ sales performance. 
3. To find the revenue of Classicmodels from January 2003 to March 2005.
4. To find Classicmodels’ customer base (country).
5. To find the credits left on “The Sharp Gifts Warehouse” for each transaction. If the total order exceeded the permitted credit amounts, it will be put "On Hold".
6. To show the popularity of each product (overall and each month) and estimate the time when each product will out of stock.

## Database
The database used is a **MySQL Sample Database**, which can be accessed here: https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-sample-database.aspx

### Attributes
* Customers : stores customer’s data. 
* Products : stores a list of scale model cars. 
* ProductLines : stores a list of product line categories. 
* Orders : stores sales orders placed by customers. 
* OrderDetails : stores sales order line items for each sales order. 
* Payments : stores payments made by customers based on their accounts. 
* Employees : stores all employee information as well as the organization structure such as who reports to whom.

## Result
### Summary

### Recommendation
1. Give **incentive/bonus** to employee number **‘1370’** as an **appreciation** to his/her astonishing result, 
and as a mean to **motivate** other employees to achieve the same.
2. Try to **refill the stocks**, especially on the **last quarter of the year**, as the # of sales will increase 
greatly at that time of the year.
3. **Build** a **great relationship** with **the USA**, as the customer base of the company is located there, by 
having a **campaign**, **thanksgiving**, or **discount events** on several occasions.
